# DevinClaw — Enterprise Security Compliance Posture

## Sensitivity

**INTERNAL**

---

## Overview

DevinClaw enforces enterprise security compliance at every layer of its architecture. All code generated, reviewed, and deployed through DevinClaw must meet SOC 2 / ISO 27001, CIS Benchmark, cloud security compliance, and Zero Trust requirements. This document defines the security posture, control mappings, and compliance obligations for all DevinClaw operations.

---

## Executive Order 14028 Alignment

DevinClaw is designed in direct response to [Executive Order 14028](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/05/12/executive-order-on-improving-the-nations-cybersecurity/) — Improving the Nation's Cybersecurity. Key mandates addressed:

| EO 14028 Mandate | DevinClaw Implementation |
|-------------------|--------------------------|
| Zero Trust Architecture adoption | Zero Trust Architecture ZTA built into every session |
| Software supply chain security | SBOM generation, dependency scanning, signed commits |
| Secure software development practices | SDD + TDD pipeline with guardrails enforcement |
| Improved detection of vulnerabilities | Automated CIS Benchmark scanning via `security-scan` skill |
| Standardized incident response | `incident-response` skill with automated triage |
| Enhanced logging and visibility | Full audit trail on every session and PR |

---

## Platform Authorization Status

| Platform | Security Certification | Security Tier | Use Case |
|----------|----------------|--------------|----------|
| **Devin Cloud** | Not cloud security compliance Certified | N/A | Generate compliant code patterns, autonomous agents in non-production |
| **Devin CLI** | Not cloud security compliance Certified | N/A | Air-gapped local execution, development environments |
| **Devin API** | Not cloud security compliance Certified | N/A | CI/CD integration, programmatic session management |
| **Devin Review** | Not cloud security compliance Certified | N/A | Automated PR review, bug detection |

**Important:** Devin generates code that complies with industry standards. Production deployment of that code must occur in a security-certified environment. Devin itself does not process, store, or transmit CUI/sensitive data.

---

## Zero Trust Architecture (Zero Trust Architecture)

DevinClaw implements the five pillars of Zero Trust across all operations:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ ZERO TRUST ARCHITECTURE │
├─────────────┬─────────────┬─────────────┬─────────────┬────────────────┤
│ IDENTITY │ DEVICE │ NETWORK │ APPLICATION │ DATA │
├─────────────┼─────────────┼─────────────┼─────────────┼────────────────┤
│ hardware tokens │ Cert-based │ Micro- │ Input │ AES-256 │
│ SAML/OIDC │ MDM posture │ segmentation│ validation │ at rest │
│ MFA │ X.509 │ Zero trust │ Auth every │ TLS 1.2+ │
│ 14+ char pw │ validation │ networking │ API call │ in transit │
└─────────────┴─────────────┴─────────────┴─────────────┴────────────────┘
```

### Core Principles

| Principle | Enforcement | Rationale |
|-----------|------------|-----------|
| **Never Trust, Always Verify** | Continuous session verification on every request | Tokens can be stolen mid-session |
| **IP-Bound Sessions** | Sessions tied to originating IP address | Stolen tokens are useless from a different IP |
| **Session Regeneration** | New session ID generated after every authentication | Prevents session fixation attacks |
| **15-Minute Timeout** | Sessions expire after 15 minutes of inactivity (CIS Benchmark SESS-001) | Limits attack window for compromised sessions |
| **Least Privilege** | Default deny; access requires explicit grant | Limits blast radius of any compromise |
| **Full Audit Trail** | Every action logged with who, what, when, where, outcome | Forensics, compliance, anomaly detection |

### Zero Trust Request Flow

```
Request → Verify Session → Check IP Binding → Check Timeout → Authorize → Process → Log
 │ │ │ │
 Missing? Mismatch? Expired? Denied?
 │ │ │ │
 REJECT DESTROY + REJECT REJECT
 (401) LOG ALERT (401) (403)
```

|---------|----------|-------------|----------------|
| AUTH-001 | Authentication | 14+ char passwords, MFA | `auth_manager.py`, `cac_piv_handler.py` |
| SESS-001 | Session Management | 15-min timeout, session regeneration, IP binding | `zero_trust_middleware.py` |
| INPUT-001 | Input Validation | Whitelist validation on all user inputs | `security_utils.py` InputValidator |
| SEC-XXX | Input Sanitization | Parameterized queries, dangerous char removal | `security_utils.py` InputSanitizer |
| CRYPTO-001 | Encryption at Rest | AES-256 for all sensitive data | Documented requirement, key rotation annually |

### Required Security Headers

All HTTP responses from DevinClaw-generated applications must include:

```
Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains
X-Frame-Options: DENY
X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'
```

---

## cloud security compliance Compliance


- All Zero Trust controls are mandatory, not optional
- hardware tokens authentication is required for enterprise/enterprise systems
- Audit logs must be retained for minimum 1 year
- Content Security Policy must be tightened for production
- All data must be encrypted at rest (AES-256) and in transit (TLS 1.2+)

### cloud security compliance Baseline (Generated Code)

All code generated by Devin must meet cloud security compliance baseline at minimum:

- Parameterized database queries (no string concatenation)
- Input validation on all user-facing endpoints
- Structured audit logging for all security events
- Secrets managed via environment variables or secret managers (never hardcoded)
- Dependency scanning with SBOM generation

---

## Software Supply Chain Security

| Control | Implementation |
|---------|----------------|
| **Signed Commits** | All commits through DevinClaw must be GPG-signed |
| **SBOM Generation** | Software Bill of Materials generated for every build |
| **Dependency Scanning** | Automated CVE scanning on all dependencies |
| **License Compliance** | All dependencies checked against approved license list |
| **Iron Bank Images** | Container base images sourced from enterprise Iron Bank when available |
| **No Secrets in Code** | Pre-commit hooks scan for credentials, API keys, and connection strings |

---

## Guardrails Integration

DevinClaw uses the Devin Enterprise Guardrails API to enforce security at the session level:

| Guardrail | Enforcement |
|-----------|------------|
| No code without spec | SDD specification must exist before implementation begins |
| No code without tests | TDD test stubs must exist before implementation |
| No merge without review | Devin Review must run on every PR |
| No deploy without audit | Guardrails API must show 0 violations |
| No skip on security | Regulatory compliance scan runs on every change |
| No sensitive data in code | Credentials, PII, sensitive data never in source |
| No unapproved production access | Staging/sandbox only unless explicitly authorized |

### Violation Handling

1. Session is flagged (not killed — human decides)
2. Violation logged to immutable audit trail
3. Team notified via configured channel (Slack/Teams)
4. Human must acknowledge before work continues
5. `guardrail-auditor` skill generates compliance report

---

## Security Templates

DevinClaw includes reusable security modules in `governance/templates/`:

| Module | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `security_utils.py` | Input validation, sanitization, rate limiting |
| `auth_manager.py` | Authentication, session management, password policies |
| `audit_logger.py` | Structured JSON audit logging |
| `zero_trust_middleware.py` | IP binding, continuous verification, session management |
| `cac_piv_handler.py` | hardware tokens X.509 certificate authentication for enterprise/enterprise systems |

---

## Compliance Testing

Run the automated compliance test suite:

```bash
# Run all Zero Trust tests
pytest governance/tests/test_zero_trust.py -v

# Run with coverage
pytest governance/tests/ -v --cov=governance/templates

# Run specific test class
pytest governance/tests/test_zero_trust.py::TestIPBoundSessions -v
```

| Test Class | Validates |
|------------|-----------|
| `TestIPBoundSessions` | Sessions reject requests from different IPs |
| `TestSessionTimeout` | Sessions expire after 15 minutes |
| `TestSessionRegeneration` | New session ID generated after auth |
| `TestContinuousVerification` | Every request must have valid session |
| `TestAuditLogging` | Security events are properly logged |
| `TestAccountLockout` | Account lockout after 5 failed attempts |
| `TestSessionSecurity` | Session IDs are cryptographically random |

---

## Incident Response

The `incident-response` skill automates security incident handling:

1. Alert received (Sentry, Datadog, or manual trigger)
2. Devin auto-investigates root cause with full codebase context
3. Remediation PR created with fix and regression tests
4. Devin Review validates the fix
5. Guardrails API confirms 0 violations post-fix
6. Full audit trail generated for the incident lifecycle

## OpenClaw Security Posture — Objective Assessment

OpenClaw serves as the orchestration and governance layer in DevinClaw. It is **not** the security boundary. This section provides an honest assessment of its security posture.

### Current State
- **Single-operator, local-first**: OpenClaw runs on individual workstations with local configuration files.
- **Plaintext token storage**: API keys and tokens are stored in local config files without encryption at rest.
- **Plugins run in-process**: OpenClaw skills and plugins execute in the same process without sandboxing or isolation.
- **No native RBAC**: Access control is binary (has access / doesn't) — no role-based granularity.
- **No native audit export**: Audit trail exists in local files but lacks standardized export for SIEM integration.

### Recommended Deployment Posture for Enterprise Use
- **Treat OpenClaw as outside the high-trust boundary.** It orchestrates and governs, but should not be trusted with unencrypted secrets or direct access to production systems.
- **For production enterprise deployment**, OpenClaw should be forked and hardened:
 - Encrypted secret store (Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, or equivalent)
 - Plugin sandboxing with allowlist-only execution
 - RBAC with integration to hardware tokens identity providers
 - Structured audit log export to customer SIEM
 - Network isolation (no direct internet access from orchestrator)
- **Session-scoped secrets**: When automating workflows, use Devin's session-scoped secret injection rather than storing secrets in OpenClaw configuration.

### What This Means in Practice
OpenClaw is valuable as a governance layer — it routes tasks, enforces SDLC gates, validates artifact contracts, and maintains the audit trail. But it is **not** a security-certified boundary. The production security posture comes from the platforms it orchestrates (Devin) and the customer's infrastructure (VPC, IAM, network controls).

This honest positioning strengthens the overall architecture: each layer does what it's best at, and no layer claims capabilities it doesn't have.
