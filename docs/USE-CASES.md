# Enterprise Modernization Use Cases

## Use Case → Skill → Devin Gallery Mapping

Each enterprise modernization scenario maps to a pre-configured DevinClaw skill and a proven Devin use case pattern.

| # | enterprise Scenario | DevinClaw Skill | Devin Gallery Pattern | Spoke(s) |
|---|-------------|----------------|----------------------|----------|
| 1 | Analyze 200+ legacy applications | `legacy-analysis` | Investigate codebase | Cloud + DeepWiki |
| 2 | Oracle PL/SQL → PostgreSQL migration | `plsql-migration` | Parallelize migration | Cloud (batch) + API |
| 3 | COBOL → modern language conversion | `cobol-conversion` | Code conversion | Cloud + CLI |
| 4 | Rationalize 3,000 databases | `db-rationalization` | Data & Analytics | Cloud (batch) |
| 5 | CIS Benchmark compliance scanning | `security-scan` | Automated security | Cloud + Review |
| 6 | Generate test suites for untested code | `test-generation` | Test coverage playbook | Cloud + CLI |
| 7 | Build new features from specs | `feature-dev` | Implement from spec | Cloud |
| 8 | Automated code review at scale | `pr-review` | Devin Review | Review (auto) |
| 9 | Production alert auto-investigation | `incident-response` | Auto-investigate alerts | API (webhook) |
| 10 | Batch migrate 50+ files in parallel | `parallel-migration` | Batch sessions | Cloud (Advanced) |
| 11 | REST→GraphQL, SOAP→REST, monolith→micro | `api-modernization` | Migration playbook | Cloud + CLI |
| 12 | Containerize legacy applications | `containerization` | Containerize app | Cloud |
| 13 | Validate SDLC compliance | `sdlc-validator` | Custom validation | OpenClaw |
| 14 | Monitor guardrail violations | `guardrail-auditor` | Enterprise API | OpenClaw |
| 15 | Create skills for new task types | `skill-creator` | Self-evolving | OpenClaw + Cloud |

## Detailed Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Day-One Legacy Analysis
**Situation**: A enterprise engineer is assigned to modernize the enterprise's notification management system. They've never seen the codebase.

**DevinClaw flow**:
1. Engineer: "Analyze the notification codebase and give me a modernization assessment"
2. DeepWiki indexes the repository in minutes
3. `legacy-analysis` skill produces: language breakdown, dependency audit, security findings, architecture diagram, modernization roadmap
4. Engineer has full context in 30 minutes instead of 2 weeks

### Scenario 2: Large-Scale PL/SQL Migration
**Situation**: The notification system has 150 Oracle PL/SQL packages that need to migrate to PostgreSQL.

**DevinClaw flow**:
1. Engineer: "Migrate all PL/SQL packages in the notification schema to PostgreSQL"
2. `plsql-migration` skill activates → inventories 150 packages → classifies complexity
3. SDD specs generated for each package
4. TDD test cases generated with Oracle baseline outputs
5. 50 parallel Devin sessions spawn → each migrates 3 packages
6. Devin Review auto-reviews all 150 PRs
7. OpenClaw validates: all tests pass, all reviews clean, zero guardrail violations
8. Advanced Devin analyzes all 50 sessions → generates improved playbook
9. Total time: days instead of months

### Scenario 3: Zero-to-Tests
**Situation**: A critical enterprise inancial system has zero test coverage. No changes can be safely made until tests exist.

**DevinClaw flow**:
1. Engineer: "Generate a comprehensive test suite for the Delphi financial module"
2. `test-generation` skill: analyze all entry points, business logic, data flows
3. Generate test plan with priority: financial calculations (100%) → API endpoints (90%) → utilities (80%)
4. Devin writes 500+ tests across unit, integration, and security categories
5. Coverage report: 87% branch coverage on first pass
6. Engineer reviews, approves, and now has a safety net for future changes

### Scenario 4: Overnight Incident Response
**Situation**: A production error occurs at 2 AM in the enterprise's acquisition system.

**DevinClaw flow**:
1. Sentry webhook fires → Devin API creates a session automatically
2. `incident-response` skill: pull error details from Sentry MCP, query Datadog for context
3. Devin traces root cause through the codebase (with DeepWiki context)
4. Fix implemented, tests added, PR created
5. By 7 AM, the fix is reviewed and ready for human approval
6. Engineer arrives to a solved problem instead of a 3-hour debugging session

### Scenario 5: The Self-Evolving System
**Situation**: An engineer needs to migrate Oracle Advanced Queuing to a modern message broker. No skill exists for this.

**DevinClaw flow**:
1. Engineer: "Migrate Oracle AQ to RabbitMQ"
2. OpenClaw checks SKILLS-MAP → no match
3. `skill-creator` meta-skill activates
4. Cross-references Devin docs, DeepWiki context, and existing migration skills
5. Creates `oracle-aq-migration` skill with full SDD→TDD→Build→Review workflow
6. Pushes to repo, updates SKILLS-MAP
7. Executes the new skill against the original task
8. Every engineer on the team now has Oracle AQ migration capability
