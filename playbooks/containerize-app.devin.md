# Playbook: Containerize Legacy Application

> **Required Knowledge:** `enterprise-modernizer`, `security-auditor`

## Overview
Create production-ready Docker containers for legacy applications as part of cloud migration. Includes multi-stage Dockerfiles, docker-compose for local development, and Kubernetes manifests for deployment.

## When to Use
- Moving enterprise applications from bare-metal/VM to container orchestration
- Cloud migration to AWS, Azure, GCP, or private cloud
- Standardizing deployment across the application portfolio

## Instructions

1. **Analyze application runtime**: Language, framework, runtime version, OS dependencies, file system usage, environment variables, ports, health check endpoints.

2. **Create multi-stage Dockerfile**:
 - Stage 1 (builder): Install dependencies, compile/build
 - Stage 2 (runtime): Minimal base image, copy only artifacts
 - Use distroless or hardened base images (Iron Bank for enterprise)
 - No root user in runtime stage
 - HEALTHCHECK instruction

3. **Create docker-compose.yml**: Application + database + cache + any dependent services for local development.

4. **Create Kubernetes manifests** (if targeting K8s):
 - Deployment with resource limits, liveness/readiness probes
 - Service for internal networking
 - ConfigMap for non-sensitive config
 - Secrets reference for credentials (external secrets operator)
 - NetworkPolicy for micro-segmentation (Zero Trust)
 - HorizontalPodAutoscaler

5. **Security hardening**:
 - Scan image with Trivy or Grype for CVEs
 - No secrets in image layers
 - Read-only root filesystem where possible
 - Drop all Linux capabilities, add only what's needed
 - CIS Benchmark Container Security Guide compliance

6. **Test**: Build image, start container, verify health check, run application test suite inside container.

## Specifications
- Base images: Use agency-approved images (Iron Bank, or hardened official images)
- Image size: Minimize — use multi-stage builds and alpine/distroless where possible
- No secrets baked into images — use runtime injection only
- All containers must run as non-root (UID 1000+)

## Advice
- Legacy apps often assume local file system access — containerize with volumes or refactor to use object storage
- JVM apps need explicit memory limits in both Dockerfile and K8s resource limits
- Test with the same container image in dev, staging, and prod — no image divergence


## Self-Verification (Devin 2.2)

Before declaring this playbook complete:

1. **Run all verification gates**: Execute the full self-verify loop — build, test, lint, typecheck, security scan. If the playbook produced code changes, run the test suite and confirm all tests pass.
2. **Auto-fix failures**: If any gate fails, attempt automated repair. Re-run the failing gate. If it fails again after 2 attempts, escalate to human reviewer.
3. **Computer-use E2E** (if applicable): For changes that affect UI or user-facing functionality, use Devin 2.2 computer use to run the application and verify functional correctness.

## Evidence Pack Generation

On completion, produce `evidence-pack.json` in the output directory:

```json
{
 "playbook": "<this playbook name>",
 "session_id": "<Devin session ID>",
 "timestamp": "<ISO 8601>",
 "artifacts": [
 { "filename": "<file>", "sha256": "<hash>", "stage": "<stage>" }
 ],
 "verification": {
 "tests_passed": true,
 "lint_clean": true,
 "security_scan_clean": true,
 "gates_failed_and_auto_fixed": []
 },
 "knowledge_updates": [],
 "escalations": []
}
```

This evidence pack is required for SDLC validation and audit trail compliance (FAR 4.703).
