# Guardrail Auditor

## Overview

This skill provides continuous governance and compliance monitoring for all Devin sessions running within a DevinClaw modernization campaign. It integrates with the Devin Enterprise Guardrails API (`/v3beta1/enterprise/guardrail-violations`) to detect policy violations in real-time, log them to the centralized audit trail, and enforce organizational security and quality standards.

In a enterprise modernization context where 50-100+ Devin sessions may be running in parallel, automated guardrail enforcement is essential. Human reviewers cannot monitor every session — this skill ensures that no violation goes undetected, no non-compliant code reaches production, and every enforcement action is documented for enterprise audit requirements.

## What's Needed From User

- **Devin Enterprise API key**: Service user credential with `ManageEnterpriseSettings` permission
- **Guardrail configuration**: Which guardrails are active (defined in `audit/guardrail-config.json`)
- **Alert channel**: Where to send violation notifications (Slack channel, Teams channel, or email)
- **Enforcement mode**: `monitor` (log only) or `enforce` (block non-compliant PRs)
- **Polling interval** (optional): How frequently to check for violations (default: every 5 minutes)

## Procedure

1. **Load guardrail configuration**
 - Read `audit/guardrail-config.json` for active guardrail rules
 - Verify Devin Enterprise API connectivity with a test call
 - Confirm service user has `ManageEnterpriseSettings` permission
 - Log audit start event with timestamp and configuration hash

2. **Poll for guardrail violations**
 - Call `GET /v3beta1/enterprise/guardrail-violations` with time window filter
 - Parameters: `time_after` = last poll timestamp, `order` = asc, `first` = 200
 - Paginate through all results if `has_next_page` is true
 - Parse each violation: session_id, guardrail_id, timestamp, details

3. **Classify violation severity**
 - **CRITICAL**: Security guardrails (credentials in code, unauthorized network access, data exfiltration attempts)
 - **HIGH**: Quality guardrails (tests not written, spec not followed, forbidden file modifications)
 - **MEDIUM**: Process guardrails (PR description missing, commit message format, branch naming)
 - **LOW**: Style guardrails (formatting, naming conventions)

4. **Log to audit trail**
 - Write each violation to `audit/violations/YYYY-MM-DD.json` in structured format:
 ```json
 {
 "timestamp": "ISO-8601",
 "session_id": "devin-session-id",
 "guardrail_id": "guardrail-rule-id",
 "severity": "CRITICAL|HIGH|MEDIUM|LOW",
 "description": "What was violated",
 "action_taken": "logged|alerted|blocked",
 "resolved": false
 }
 ```
 - Append to running daily log — never overwrite

5. **Alert on violations**
 - CRITICAL: Immediate alert to all configured channels + attempt to pause the session
 - HIGH: Alert to primary channel within 1 minute
 - MEDIUM: Batch alerts every 15 minutes
 - LOW: Include in daily summary report only
 - Alert format: `[GUARDRAIL VIOLATION] Severity: {X} | Session: {id} | Rule: {name} | Details: {description}`

6. **Enforce compliance (if enforcement mode is active)**
 - For CRITICAL/HIGH violations: add a comment to the associated PR requesting fix before merge
 - For sessions with 3+ unresolved violations: flag session for human review
 - Block merge of any PR with unresolved CRITICAL findings
 - Maintain a compliance scorecard per session and per engineer

7. **Generate compliance reports**
 - Daily summary: total sessions, total violations by severity, resolution rate, top violated rules
 - Weekly trend: violation rate over time, improving/degrading areas, engineer compliance scores
 - On-demand: full audit export for regulatory compliance reviews (JSON + CSV formats)

8. **Validate SDLC completion**
 - Cross-reference with `audit/sdlc-checklist.json` for every completed session:
 - [ ] SDD spec document exists in PR
 - [ ] TDD test plan exists
 - [ ] All tests passing
 - [ ] Devin Review completed with no unresolved CRITICAL bugs
 - [ ] Guardrails: zero CRITICAL/HIGH violations
 - [ ] Security scan completed
 - Sessions missing any checklist item are flagged as incomplete

## Specifications

- **Polling interval**: Configurable, default 5 minutes, minimum 1 minute
- **Retention**: Violation logs retained indefinitely (enterprise audit requirement)
- **API pagination**: Handle up to 10,000 violations per polling cycle
- **Time window**: Maximum 100-day lookback per API call (Devin API constraint)
- **Concurrency**: Single auditor instance per DevinClaw deployment (avoid duplicate alerts)
- **Idempotency**: Track last processed violation cursor to avoid re-processing

## Advice and Pointers

- Start in `monitor` mode for the first week to establish baseline violation rates before switching to `enforce`
- The most common violations in migration campaigns are: missing test coverage, hardcoded connection strings from copied legacy code, and overly broad file access patterns
- Keep guardrail rules specific and actionable — vague rules generate false positives that erode trust in the system
- Review and tune guardrail rules weekly based on violation patterns — too many LOW violations create alert fatigue
- Enterprise auditors will ask for the violation log during compliance certification reviews — ensure the log format is clean and queryable


## Self-Verification Loop (Devin 2.2)

After completing the primary procedure:

1. **Self-verify**: Run all applicable verification gates:
 - Build/test gates: API connectivity confirmed, violation log integrity verified
 - Audit gates: no gaps in polling timeline, all violations sensitive and logged
 - Alert gates: notification delivery confirmed for Critical/High violations
2. **Auto-fix**: If any verification gate fails, attempt automated repair — adjust code, configuration, or test fixtures to resolve the failure.
3. **Re-verify**: Run all verification gates again after fixes. Confirm each gate transitions from FAIL to PASS.
4. **Escalate**: If auto-fix fails after 2 attempts, escalate to human reviewer with a complete evidence pack. Include the failing gate identifier, error output, attempted fixes, and root cause hypothesis.

## Artifact Contract

Every stage of this skill produces paired outputs for machine-consumable handoff:

| Stage | Markdown Output | JSON Output |
|-------|----------------|-------------|
| Violation Polling | `violation_poll.md` | `violation_poll.json` |
| Violation Analysis | `violation_analysis.md` | `violation_analysis.json` |
| Alert Generation | `alert_generation.md` | `alert_generation.json` |
| Compliance Report | `compliance_report.md` | `compliance_report.json` |

JSON outputs must conform to the schema defined in `audit/artifact-schemas/`. Markdown outputs are the human-readable narrative; JSON outputs are the machine-consumable contract consumed by the next stage or by OpenClaw for artifact validation.

## Evidence Pack

On completion, produce `evidence-pack.json` containing:

```json
{
 "session_id": "<Devin session identifier>",
 "timestamp": "<ISO 8601 completion time>",
 "skill_id": "devinclaw.guardrail_auditor.v1",
 "artifacts": [
 {
 "filename": "<output file>",
 "sha256": "<SHA-256 hash of file contents>",
 "stage": "<which stage produced this artifact>"
 }
 ],
 "verification": {
 "gates_run": ["<gate_1>", "<gate_2>"],
 "gates_passed": ["<gate_1>", "<gate_2>"],
 "gates_failed": [],
 "auto_fix_attempts": 0,
 "test_summary": {"passed": 0, "failed": 0, "skipped": 0},
 "scan_summary": {"critical": 0, "high": 0, "medium": 0, "low": 0}
 },
 "knowledge_updates": [
 {
 "action": "created|updated",
 "knowledge_id": "<Devin knowledge entry ID>",
 "summary": "<what was learned>"
 }
 ],
 "escalations": [
 {
 "gate": "<failing gate>",
 "reason": "<why auto-fix failed>",
 "evidence": "<link to error output>"
 }
 ]
}
```

## Escalation Policy

- **Divergence threshold**: 0.35 — if parallel verification sessions disagree beyond this threshold on key findings, escalate to human reviewer with both evidence packs for adjudication.
- **Human approval required for**: guardrail rule modifications, violation severity reclassification, enforcement mode changes (monitor → enforce), audit log export for compliance certification.
- **Auto-escalate on**: Any security finding rated HIGH or CRITICAL, any risk of data loss or corruption, any changes to authentication or authorization logic, any modification to safety-critical code paths (DO-178C applicable systems).

## Forbidden Actions

- Do not delete or modify violation log entries — audit logs are immutable
- Do not disable guardrails without explicit human authorization logged in the audit trail
- Do not automatically resolve violations — only humans can mark violations as resolved
- Do not expose API credentials in violation reports or alerts
- Do not skip polling cycles — if the API is unavailable, log the outage and retry with exponential backoff
