# Audit & Governance

DevinClaw maintains a complete audit trail for every action across all sessions. This directory contains the configuration and templates for governance enforcement.

## Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `guardrail-config.json` | Active guardrail rules for Devin Enterprise |
| `sdlc-checklist.json` | What OpenClaw validates for every completed task |
| `audit-template.json` | Standard format for audit log entries |
| `violations/` | Daily violation logs (auto-generated by guardrail-auditor skill) |

## Guardrails API Integration

DevinClaw integrates with the Devin Enterprise Guardrails API:
- Endpoint: `GET /v3beta1/enterprise/guardrail-violations`
- Polling: Every 5 minutes (configurable)
- Severity: CRITICAL → immediate alert, HIGH → 1 min, MEDIUM → 15 min batch, LOW → daily summary
- Enforcement: CRITICAL/HIGH violations block PR merge until resolved

## Enterprise Audit Requirements

All audit data is retained indefinitely per enterprise records management requirements:
- Every session: start time, end time, user, task, outcome
- Every file modification: what changed, who changed it, when, why
- Every security finding: severity, control mapping, remediation status
- Every guardrail violation: rule, session, timestamp, resolution
