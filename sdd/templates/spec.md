### EARS Format Reference

| Type | Pattern | When to Use |
|------|---------|-------------|
| **Ubiquitous** | "The [system] shall [action]." | Always-active behavior, no trigger needed |
| **Event-driven** | "When [event], the [system] shall [action]." | Behavior triggered by a specific event |
| **State-driven** | "While [state], the [system] shall [action]." | Behavior active only during a specific state |
| **Conditional** | "If [condition], then the [system] shall [action]." | Behavior dependent on a condition being true |
