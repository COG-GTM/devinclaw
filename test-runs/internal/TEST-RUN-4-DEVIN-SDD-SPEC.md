# Test Run 4 (Retry): SDD Spec Generation — DEVIN CLI
**Target:** `legacy-sample-app/legacy-client` — SQL Injection remediation
**Skill:** SDD spec generation using spec.md template
**Spoke:** **Devin CLI** (`devin --model opus --permission-mode dangerous`)
**Date:** 2026-02-24 11:20 PM PST

---

## Result: ✅ COMPLETE — 340 lines, production-grade SDD

### What Devin Produced
- **12 EARS-format requirements** (REQ-SQL-001 through REQ-DID-002)
- **6 real industry security CIS Benchmark controls** mapped with V-numbers and CCIs
- **3 vulnerability classes** identified (not just the one we told it about)
- **21 acceptance criteria** across 6 categories
- **Before/after code** for the fix
- **Full traceability matrix** (Requirement → CIS Benchmark Rule → CWE → Acceptance Criteria)

### What Devin Found That We Missed
1. **10 additional table-name injection points** — we only flagged line 371. Devin found `this.config.table` concatenated in DDL/DML across 10 more locations (lines 137, 158, 169, 287, 294, 431, 449, 471, 489, 509, 560)
2. **autoCommit bug** — `conn.setAutoCommit(false)` in finally block should be `true` (line 277)
3. **Resource leak** — PreparedStatement not closed on early-return paths at lines 376/379
4. **NotamDbConfig.setTable() needs validation** — defense-in-depth recommendation we didn't think of

### Score: 10/10
This is exactly what a enterprise security engineer wants to see. EARS requirements, security benchmark mapping with V-numbers, CWEs, acceptance criteria with verification methods, and a traceability matrix. An compliance package could include this directly.
