# Devin Knowledge Entries

## What Is This?

These are [Devin Knowledge entries](https://docs.devin.ai/product-guides/knowledge) — domain expertise that Devin automatically recalls when working on related tasks. Each file contains a **trigger description** and **content** following Devin's native Knowledge format.

Knowledge entries make Devin a enterprise domain expert from the first prompt. Instead of generic code generation, Devin understands CIS Benchmark controls, enterprise system architecture, Oracle-to-PostgreSQL migration patterns, and COBOL conversion strategies.

## How They Work

1. Upload each file as a Knowledge entry in Devin's Settings & Library
2. Set the **Trigger Description** from the `trigger:` field in each file
3. Devin automatically retrieves the right knowledge when the task matches

## Relationship to Skills and Playbooks
