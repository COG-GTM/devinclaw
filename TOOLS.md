# DevinClaw Tools Reference

This document catalogs every MCP server, Devin execution spoke, and API endpoint available in the DevinClaw framework. Tools are organized by layer: OpenClaw orchestration and Devin execution.

---

## MCP Servers — OpenClaw Layer

These MCP servers provide the orchestration layer with access to external systems, data sources, and infrastructure. They run within the OpenClaw process and are available to the routing engine, guardrail evaluator, and skill executor.

## MCP Servers — Devin Layer

These MCP servers bridge the OpenClaw orchestrator to Devin's execution capabilities. They translate orchestration commands into Devin-native operations.

| MCP Server | Transport | Purpose | Key Capabilities |
|------------|-----------|---------|------------------|
| `devin-cloud-mcp` | SSE | Parallel cloud session management | Spawn sessions (up to 100+ concurrent), monitor execution progress, collect artifacts, manage session lifecycle, aggregate results across parallel runs |
| `devin-cli-mcp` | stdio | Local/air-gapped execution | Run Devin locally without external network, manage local model cache, execute in SCIF-compatible mode, support disconnected operation |

| `benchmark-scanner-mcp` | stdio | industry security benchmark compliance | Run security benchmarks, parse compliance report results, map findings to benchmark IDs (AUTH-001 through HEADERS-001), generate remediation scripts, produce compliance reports |
| `security-controls-mcp` | stdio | SOC 2 / ISO 27001 validation | Validate control implementations, map code changes to control families, generate control assessment evidence, track remediation tracking items |
| `sbom-mcp` | stdio | Software Bill of Materials | Generate SBOM in CycloneDX/SPDX formats, track component versions, validate license compliance, detect known vulnerabilities |
| `ironbank-mcp` | SSE | enterprise Iron Bank integration | Validate container images against Iron Bank hardening guide, pull approved base images, submit hardening manifests |

## Devin Execution Spokes

Spokes are the five modalities through which Devin executes work. OpenClaw selects the appropriate spoke(s) based on task requirements, security classification, and deployment context.

| Spoke | Mode | Authorization | Concurrency | Network | Use Cases |
|-------|------|---------------|-------------|---------|-----------|
| **Devin Cloud** | Remote sandboxed VMs | Commercial + GovCloud | 100+ parallel sessions | Full internet | Batch modernization campaigns, large-scale COBOL migration, fleet-wide security remediation, mass test generation, parallel vulnerability scanning |
| **Devin CLI** | Local terminal process | On-premises authorized | 1 per terminal | Air-gapped capable | air-gapped operations, secure workloads, disconnected development, local prototyping, high-security environments |
| **Devin API** | REST endpoint | API key authenticated | Rate-limited (100 req/min) | HTTPS only | CI/CD pipeline integration, scheduled batch jobs, programmatic task submission, automated nightly runs, webhook-driven workflows |
| **Devin Review** | PR webhook listener | GitLab/GitHub integration | 1 per MR/PR | HTTPS only | Automated pull request review, security benchmark compliance checking, code quality enforcement, architectural drift detection, security finding triage |

### Spoke Selection Matrix

OpenClaw uses this matrix to automatically select the appropriate spoke:

| Scenario | Primary Spoke | Fallback Spoke | Rationale |
|----------|---------------|----------------|-----------|
| Batch migration (100+ files) | Cloud | API | Maximizes parallelism |
| Single file fix | API | CLI | Lightweight, fast |
| Air-gapped environment | CLI | — | Only option without network |
| Interactive development | CLI | CLI | Developer-in-the-loop |
| PR compliance check | Review | API | Webhook-native |
| CI/CD pipeline stage | API | Cloud | Pipeline integration |
| Secure workload (high-security tier) | CLI | — | Authorization boundary |
| Large refactor with review | Cloud + Review | API + Review | Build then review |

## Verification & Governance Artifacts

These configuration files govern the DevinClaw verification system and are consumed by the OpenClaw orchestrator at runtime:

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `audit/arena-config.json` | Risk classification per skill, arena execution mode (single-run vs. arena-run), session counts, safety-critical overrides |
| `audit/constitution-template.json` | SDLC stage boundary definitions with required inputs, outputs, and gate criteria at each stage transition |
| `audit/skill-descriptors.json` | Machine-consumable skill registry with triggers, risk levels, MCP requirements, and hard gate mappings |
| `audit/artifact-schemas/evidence-pack.schema.json` | JSON Schema for evidence-pack.json — validates artifact inventory, verification results, and escalation records |
| `audit/artifact-schemas/verification-record.schema.json` | JSON Schema for verification records produced by the divergence detection system |

OpenClaw validates all task artifacts against these schemas before accepting a "done" status. See [docs/VERIFICATION-SYSTEM.md](docs/VERIFICATION-SYSTEM.md) for the complete verification architecture.
