# DevinClaw — End-to-End Test Plan

**Purpose:** Validate that DevinClaw works as advertised. An engineer with zero context clones this repo, follows setup, and solves real enterprise-scale modernization problems.

**Principle:** Every test uses real open-source code that mirrors enterprise systems — Java, COBOL, PL/SQL, legacy databases. No toy examples.

---

## Test Environment Requirements

- macOS or Linux workstation
- Node.js 20+
- Git
- Devin API key (free tier works for CLI tests)
- GitHub account (for PR creation tests)

---

## Test Suite 1: Cold Start (Can a stranger use this?)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/COG-GTM/devinclaw.git
cd devinclaw
chmod +x setup.sh
./setup.sh
```
**Pass criteria:** Setup completes without errors. OpenClaw is running. Skills are loaded.

### T1.2 — Smoke Test
```bash
bash scripts/smoke_test.sh
```
**Pass criteria:** 110/110 checks pass.

### T1.3 — SDLC Validation
```bash

| P2 | T2.3, T3.2 | COBOL — important but lower volume than Java/PL/SQL |
| P2 | T5.1 | DB rationalization — proves the 3,000 database story |
